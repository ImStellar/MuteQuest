# MuteAllQuestUsers

A toggle that when activated mutes all Quest Users in your lobby.

# Bugs

Only time you might have a problem with this is if you are using other clients that have the same uspeak patch and it's overriding it, or the UI is getting overlapped by another client's UI in this case you can just go into DNSpy and change the button location.

# Updates

Nothing else planned so far, this *should* be the final release.
